Verification Server

The Verification Server is a dedicated authentication and validation layer within the CodeGuardian ecosystem. It ensures that all incoming requests are authentic, well-structured, and authorized before being processed by the core system.

ðŸ”‘ Key Responsibilities

Identity Verification â€“ Confirms that requests originate from legitimate users.

Request Validation â€“ Ensures all communications follow expected formats and rules.

Integrity Protection â€“ Prevents tampering and unauthorized modifications.

Immutable Logging â€“ Maintains unalterable records of all verifications for dispute resolution.

ðŸš€ Why It Matters

The Verification Server acts as a trust gatekeeper. By validating every request and recording evidence, it strengthens accountability and provides reliable proof in buyer-seller interactions. This makes it a critical security component for CodeGuardianâ€™s marketplace model.
